  abstract = {Computer vision is a branch of computer science that studies how computers can ‘see’. It is a field that provides significant value for advancements in academia and artificial intelligence by processing images captured with a camera. In other words, the purpose of computer vision is to impart computers with the functions of human eyes and realise ‘vision’ among computers. Deep learning is a method of realising computer vision using image recognition and object detection technologies. Since its emergence, computer vision has evolved rapidly with the development of deep learning and has significantly improved image recognition accuracy. Moreover, an expert system can imitate and reproduce the flow of reasoning and decision making executed in human experts’ brains to derive optimal solutions. Machine learning, including deep learning, has made it possible to ‘acquire the tacit knowledge of experts’, which was not previously achievable with conventional expert systems. Machine learning ‘systematises tacit knowledge’ based on big data and measures phenomena from multiple angles and in large quantities. In this review, we discuss some knowledge-based computer vision techniques that employ deep learning.},

The development of these advanced technologies has also increased security and privacy issues. One kind of this issue is Deepfakes which is the combined word of deep learning and fake. DeepFake refers to the formation of a fake image or video using artificial intelligence approaches which are created for political abuse, fake data transfer, and pornography. This paper has developed a Deepfake detection method by examining the computer vision features of the digital content. The computer vision features based on the frame change are extracted using a proposed deep learning model called the Cascaded Deep Sparse Auto Encoder (CDSAE) trained by temporal CNN. The detection process is performed using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to classify the deep fake image/video from the real image/video. The proposed model is implemented using Face2Face, FaceSwap, and DFDC datasets which have secured an improved detection rate when compared to the traditional deep fake detection approaches.},

  abstract = {The face is an important part of the human body, distinguishing individuals in large groups of people. Thus, because of its universality and uniqueness, it has become the most widely used and accepted biometric method. The domain of face recognition has gained the attention of many scientists, and hence it has become a standard benchmark in the area of human recognition. It has turned out to be the most deeply studied area in computer vision for more than four decades. It has a wide array of applications, including security monitoring, automated surveillance systems, victim and missing-person identification and so on. This review presents the broad range of methods used for face recognition and attempts to discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Initially, we present the basics of face-recognition technology, its standard workflow, background and problems, and the potential applications. Then, face-recognition methods with their advantages and limitations are discussed. The concluding section presents the possibilities and future implications for further advancing the field.},

  abstract = {As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.},

  abstract = {Within a human's lifetime, faces are the visually embellished images that appear most frequently. Facial Recognition is the ability to recognize and discover someone primarily based totally on their facial features. Because the face is multidimensional, it necessitates several mathematical calculations. Thus, this work is aimed at developing an improved face recognition system that will serve in numerous application areas. Many approaches have already been developed, but they have low recognition capabilities and a high false alarm rate. As a result, there is a need for face recognition system that is more accurate and has a shorter recognition time. Due to rising security concerns and the quick development of mobile devices, face detection has recently been a hot research area. This paper focuses on the implementation of a face recognition system for human identification based on the open-source computer vision library (OpenCV) with python.At last the current application areas related to face recognition system is represented.},

  abstract = {With the extraordinary growth in images and video data sets, there is a mind-boggling want for programmed understanding and evaluation of data with the assistance of smart frameworks, since physically it is a long way off. Individuals, unlike robots, have a limited capacity to distinguish unexpected expressions. As a result, the programmed face proximity frame- work is important in face identification, appearance recognition, head-present evaluation, human-PC cooperation, and other applications. Software that uses facial recognition for face detection and identification is regarded as biometric. This study converts the mathematical aspects of a person’s face into a face print, which is then stored in a database to verify an individual’s identification. A deep learning system compares a digital image or an image taken quickly to a previously stored image(which is saved in the database). The face has a significant function in interpersonal communication for identifying oneself. Face recognition technology determines the size and placement of a human face in a digital picture. Facial recognition software has a wide range of uses in the consumer market and in the security and surveillance sectors. The COVID pandemic has brought facial recognition into greater focus lately than ever before. Face detection and recognition play a vital part in security systems that people need to interact with without making physical contact. The pattern of online exam proctoring is employing face detection and recognition. Facial recognition is used in the airline sector to enable rapid, accurate identification and verification at every stage of the passenger trip. In this research, we focused on image quality because it is the major drawback in existing algorithms and used OPEN CV, Face Recognition, and designed algorithms using libraries in python. This study discusses a method for facial recognition along with its implementation and applications.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

  abstract = {To accurately predict tropospheric ozone concentration(O3), it is needed to investigate the variety of artificial intelligence techniques’ performance, such as machine learning, deep learning and hybrid models. This research aims to effectively predict the hourly ozone trend via fewer input variables. This ozone prediction attempt is performed on diversity data of air pollutants (NO2, NOx, CO, SO2) and meteorological parameters (wind-speed and humidity). The historical datasets are collected from 3 sites in Malaysia. The study’s methodology progressed in two paths: standalone and hybrid models where hourly-averaged datasets are applied based on 5-time horizon analysis scenario, with different inputs’ combinations. For evaluation, all models are tested throughout 5-performance indicator and illustrated on Modified Taylor diagram. Sensitivity analysis of input variables is quantified. Additionally, uncertainty analysis is conducted to assess their confidence level associated with Willmott Index. Based on R2, results indicated that XGBoost has higher accuracy compared to MLP and SVR; meanwhile, LSTM and CNN outweighs XGBoost. In terms of robustness and accuracy, the proposed hybrid model possesses superlative performance compared to all above-mentioned techniques. The proposed model achieved exceptional results as the highest R2, the highest 95\% confidence degree, and narrower confidence interval width, are 93.48\%, 98.16\%, and 0.0014195, respectively.},

  abstract = {Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},
