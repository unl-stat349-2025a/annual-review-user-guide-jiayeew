# Topic: Visual Pattern Recognition

1. Defination of what is visual pattern recognition

2. A brief explanation of some specific task in Visual Pattern Recognition
- Facial recognition
- Object Detection 

3. Cover software packages & libraries 
- OpenCV
- TenserFlow/Keras
- scikit-learn


4. When to use or not to use a specific technique
- When to use deep learning vs. traditional computer vision techniques: Deep learning learns features automatically but requires training and a large dataset, whereas traditional computer vision requires manual feature extraction and works with a small dataset.
- Choosing the right classification model: Explain when to use SVMs, neural networks, or decision trees.
